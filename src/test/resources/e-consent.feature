Feature: e-Consent feature
  As a mortgage loan applicant, I want to consent to do business electronically so that I can receive and sign the necessary disclosures related to my loan application. I need to be able to enter my first and last name and email address,
  and I want to be able to easily indicate whether or not I agree to the terms and conditions.
