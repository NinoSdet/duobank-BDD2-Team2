Feature: Reviewing-Application feature
  As a mortgage loan applicant, I want to be able to review and edit the details of my loan application
  on a summary page so that I can ensure that all of the information is accurate and up-to-date.
  I want to be able to edit any section of the application, including the pre-approval inquiry,
  personal details, expenses, employment and income, and eConsent.
  Once I have made any necessary changes, I want to be able to submit the application.

  Scenario: The Summary page should be accessible from the main application flow
